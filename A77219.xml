            <title>The afflicted and retired mans meditations, concerning the excellency of the spirit With a discovery of the twofold-mind; the danger of the one, the comfort and safety of the other. First, here is observed, what it is for to be carnally minded. Secondly, means to suppress a carnal frame of spirit. Thirdly, the dreadful state of a carnal minded man. Fourthly, how the spirit is a Christians help. Fifthly, means to obtain the spirit. Sixthly, the characters of a spiritualized Christian. Seventhly, the glorious priviledges of a spiritual minded man. And a few meditations by way of observation: with a dialogue between Christ and a sinner; Christ and a Christian; Christ and the afflicted person: as also, a word to the remnant of the womans seed: with a loud call to all saints, to love one another upon the account of son-ship, and not onely upon the account of fellowship.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>FOr the ſatisfaction of many, or any who deſire to follow the Lord Jeſus in ſincerity, I am here en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to write a ſmall Epiſtle, to the furtherance, propagating and owning of this following Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; wherein is contained and couched many glorious Truths, which did concern all perſons to look after in former Ages of the World, but now more eſpecially we that live in this laſt Age, wherein Errors do abound, and great Miſtakes do ariſe in many, whom I deſire the Lord would be pleaſed to help to underſtand between Truth and Error, by his own Spirit,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.29.</note> which is the beſt Teacher in the world, though at this day it is much ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and little looked after by the ſons of men.</p>
            <p>Chriſtian Reader, my deſire is that thou wouldeſt be pleaſed carefully to read, and ſeriouſly conſider this fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Treatiſe, with a ſingle heart and eye,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 12.33. <hi>Acts</hi> 2.46.</note> and imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al affections, then doubtleſs in the concluſion, thou wilt not think thy time ill ſpent. I do further deſire that thou mayeſt daily ſearch the Scripture, and bring the things contained in the enſuing Treatiſe to the Touchſtone of God's Word, to the end thou mayeſt, with the noble <hi>Bereans</hi> of old,<note place="margin">
                  <hi>Acts</hi> 17 11.</note> be enabled to diſcern between Truth and Error, between Life and Death, to know wherein thy Life lieth, yea, wherein it doth conſiſt,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.21.</note> and labour to be obedient unto that command, <hi>Try all things, and hold
<pb facs="tcp:133201:3"/> faſt that which is good.</hi> And alſo remember, my dear Friend, that the <hi>Bereans were counted more noble than them of Theſſalonica</hi> [they hearing the words of <hi>Paul,</hi> which were cried up for ſtrange Doctrine, yea, Hereſie at that day] <hi>they ſearched the Scriptures daily, to ſee whether thoſe things Paul aſſerted and preached, were truth or not.</hi> Even ſo, although many things herein contained, may be counted rediculous or erroneous; Yet courteous Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, let me deſire thee to prove thy ſelf a <hi>Berean</hi> in this matter, <hi>Search the Scripture, and ſee whether it be ſo or not.</hi> Further, my deſire is, that the Meſſage may not be ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by reaſon of the meanneſs of the Meſſenger, but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther look upon him that ſends this Meſſage into the World: obſerve when the great Men of the world have a Token to ſend unto a Friend, they do not alwayes make uſe of rich, great, or noble Men to conveigh it, but many times employ the meaneſt Servant of the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in that ſervice, to give out the token, though it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo rich a gift, or pretious a jewel.</p>

And you my Friend the Meſſenger, be not diſcouraged in your labour, for conſider the beſt Doctrine, the trueſt Doctrine, the glorieſt Tidings, and rareſt Sermon that ever was preached by the mouth of our dear Lord Jeſus himſelf, was by the Scribes and Phariſees rejected, and alſo queſtioned where he had his

            </p>
            <p>Reader, if in this little Treatiſe you meet with any thing doth not agree with the Word of God, and the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine according to godlineſs, after diligent ſearch and due enquiry into the Scripture, the pretious word of God, renounce it as not worthy the owning or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing.</p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak by way of alluſion to the noble Apoſtle in another caſe; I do judge the Author hath the Spirit of God, by which this enſuing Diſcource was penned; <hi>I ſpeak the truth of God, I lie not.</hi> Though true it is, the deareſt of Gods children are ſubject to miſcarry, yea many failings and temptations doth attend them; and the Lord did formerly ſuffer the Author hereof in meaſure to fall, yet through mercy not totally, nor final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, but he is recovered out of the horrible pit, and out of the miry clay, and the Lord hath ſet him upon a rock,<note place="margin">

<pb facs="tcp:133201:4"/> in your affections, without good enquiry of the ſame. This I urge the more for that tender love I bear unto Chriſt and his Truths, Cauſe, Kingdom, and People; and I dare not ſpeak or write more then I do know or can affirm concerning the Author. Mark, ſince the work of repentance has been wrought in his Soul, I am one that have had very much familiar acquaintance with him: with whom I do, and for ſome ſeaſon have walked in the Faith and Order of the Goſpel, and I hope in ſincerity of heart I ſpeak it; I have not I ſay, ſince the work of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance was manifeſted, known any thing but his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, his Life, his Behaviour, namely his whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, is as becomes the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt. And that he hath made it his whole work at all opportunities to propagate the Goſpel; to be inſtructing, building up and helping forward of poor ſinners in the pretious ways of dear Jeſus; and what he could not do by way of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Preaching, he hath laid hold of an opportunity by way of Writing, not deſiring to hide his talent in a napkin.</p>

            <p>AMong many of the Providential appearances of the Lord to me, I judge this to be none of the leaſt, that I ſhould ſpeak by Epiſtle in Print, which was the leaſt of my thoughts. Surely Saints, the Lord is about to ſpeak, when he opens the mouths of Babes and Sucklings, <hi>Pſalm. 8.2.</hi> And ſeeing God hath put this opportunity into my Hand, I ſhall endeavour to deal Faithfully between God, and you, and my own ſoul: And ſo I ſhall crave your patience, to conſider three or four things which the Lord hath put into my Heart, to commend to your conſideration. Me-thinks I hear the Lords people ſpeaking in the Language of them in <hi>Iſa. 21.11. Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, What of the Night?</hi> Give me leave to whiſper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong you, O ye Saints, among the loud cry of your Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that the Lord ſpeaks at this Day, four-fold, (that is to ſay) four things God ſpeaks to be our work at this Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Voice of God at this day beſpeaks you, Oh ye Saints, to Act Faith, <hi>2 Chron. 20.20.</hi> And hear O ye Saints, pray as the Diſciples, <hi>Luke 17.5. Lord increaſe our Faith, for if we believe, all things ſhall be poſſible,</hi> Mark <hi>9.23. Hard things ſhall be made eaſie,</hi> Heb. <hi>11.</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:133201:6"/> from the <hi>33.</hi> to the <hi>38.</hi> Yea, <hi>the crooked wayes ſhall be made ſtreight, rough wayes ſmooth;</hi> and whileſt we are going in this Wilderneſs, to comfort us, Faith will give us a view of the Good Land, <hi>Heb. 11.1.</hi> Yea, it will lead us up to the top of Mount <hi>Nebo;</hi> yea, let me ſay as <hi>David, Pſal. 145.11, 12.</hi> Conſider, Faith is that which Honours God, that God hath engaged himſelf to honour them who honour him, <hi>1 Sam. 2.30.</hi> Faith will tell us, <hi>He will never leave us nor forſake us;</hi> Faith will prevent deſpair in our Souls, <hi>Pſalm. 27.13. We ſhould faint, if we did not believe to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord, in the Land of the Living;</hi> Faith will teach us, that all things ſhall work for good, <hi>Rom. 8.28.</hi> Faith will help us to know that our Redeemer lives, <hi>John 19.25.</hi> and to ſay with <hi>Thomas, My Lord and my God, John 20.28.</hi> What ſhould I ſay more? it is pretious, <hi>2 Pet. 1.</hi> yea, it is very neceſſary, <hi>Heb. 11.6.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> The Voice of God ſpeaks us to be patient; and therefore O ye Saints beg patience, let it have its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect work in your Souls, <hi>James 1.4.</hi> Patience will gain thee a look from God, when frowardneſſe will make him ſtand a-loofe off; it is that will make a long way ſhort, <hi>James 5.7, 8.</hi> The Spirit of patience is oppoſite to a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring frame of Spirit. <hi>(Mark) Iſrael</hi> got nothing by a murmuring Spirit, <hi>Pſal. 106.23, 29.</hi> Patience will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent from tempting God, and limitting of God; it will help thee to ſubmit to the Lord, and it will teach thee to know that the Lord is juſt in afflicting, <hi>Mich. 7.9.</hi> Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the Counſel of your Lord, <hi>Luke 21.19. In your pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence poſſeſs ye your Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb facs="tcp:133201:7"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> The Voice of God ſpeaks us to love. And O ye Saints, How ought you to love one another? Oh! that this Grace of love might abound in your Souls: <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>Love is of God, 1 John 4.8.</hi> Yea, he that loves not his Brother, hath not the love of God in him. Conſider O ye Saints, it become the Servant to be obedient to his Maſter; hark Chriſtians, it is the command of your Lord, to love one another, <hi>John 15.12.</hi> Would you be accounted the Friends of Chriſt? then love one another: Saints, there lies the greateſt engagement in the World upon you to love.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> The Father hath loved you, he choſe you out of love, <hi>Epheſ. 1.5. Hoſ. 14.4. John 3.16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> The Son hath loved you: Oh! height of love; Chriſt's love to us, was ſelf-abaſing love, <hi>Phil. 2.7.</hi> compared with <hi>Prov. 8.</hi> from <hi>22.</hi> to <hi>31.</hi> it was wrath-appeaſing love, <hi>Epheſ. 2.14.</hi> it was a Juſtice-ſatisfying Love, <hi>Mat. 27.46.</hi> It was bleeding Love, <hi>Luke 22.44. Heb. 9.12.</hi> It was dying Love, <hi>Rom. 5.6, 8.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> The Spirit Loves you, <hi>1 Cor. 3.16.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What ſhall I ſay more, they all wrought equally in the Work of our Redemption and Salvation, and this was Love again. Oh ye Saints! conſider, The World hates you, <hi>John 15.18, 19, 20.</hi> Oh! therefore love one another; it is enough Saints, the Lord whips you, but that is love too, <hi>Heb. 12.6.</hi> But conſider, the Enemy hates, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do you love; let not Saints he ſmiting one another, that is the work of the unprofitable Servant: Oh! let not Saints come under this reproof, to afflict the afflicted, <hi>Zach. 1.15. Sion</hi> is now in the Furnace, and Saints, it is the great deſign of God to burn up this droſs, the want of love, <hi>Zeph. 3.8, 9.</hi> What ſhall I ſay more? O love the Lord all ye his Saints, and ye who love the Lord love one another.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:133201:7"/>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Voice of God at this day, ſpeaks Saints to be Humble. Doſt thou hope to be exalted Saint? then be Humble, <hi>Pſal. 113.7, 8. Numb. 12.3.</hi> Wouldſt thou have the Commendation of God? then lie low, humility will help thee to ſay, <hi>leſs then the leaſt of all Saints,</hi> Epheſ. <hi>3.8.</hi> Would you O ye Saints be taught of God? be Humble; Would you have God to dwell with you? be Humble; he takes care to revive the Humble. I ſhall have done, onely beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that God would imprint that word upon all our Souls, Phil. <hi>2.3, 4. Let nothing be done through ſtrife or vain-glory, but in lowlineſs of Mind, let each eſteem others better then themſelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A Word to the Faithful Unbyaſſed Reader, as to the enſuing Treatiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Friend, Thou wilt find thoſe things contained in this Treatiſe, very ſoundly and ſollidly handled; thou wilt find but little of the inticing words of mans Wiſdom, but doubtleſs thou mayeſt find much of the Teachings of God in plainneſs of Speech. As to the Author of it, I have this to ſay, That he hath been in the Furnace, wherein I hope, he hath loſt much droſs, and ſo is become a Veſſel more fit for his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters uſe. Reader, What thou readeſt, weigh in the Ballance of the Sanctuary, and thou wilt find, God ſpeaks much by it. If thou getteſt nothing, blame thine own heart, for the Heart of man is deceitful; If thou art a gainer, give God the Glory, and let the Author have thy Prayers. The Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe diſcovers the <hi>Carnal Mind,</hi> what it is, and to what it leads; If thy Heart be Carnal, tremble, and be timely warned; if by it thou findeſt thy ſelf in a Spiritual Frame,
<pb facs="tcp:133201:8"/> beg of the Lord to keep thee ſo. To conclude, be like the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Bereans,</hi> which were more Noble than they of <hi>Theſſalo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nica;</hi> why? becauſe they ſearcht the Scriptures, to ſee if thoſe things which were ſpoken by <hi>Paul,</hi> were ſo. Now the God of Grace, fill you with ſtreams from that full Fountain the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The bleſſed Apoſtle makes mention of a twofold Mind, and the Events thereof; Firſt he ſpeaks of the <hi>Carnal Mind,</hi> and tells us that tends to <hi>Death.</hi>
               </p>

               </p>

                  <head>The ſecond Diſcription of the Carnal Mind.</head>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>To be Carnally Minded, is to have our Minds running out unto that which tends unto the Diſhonour of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of ſuch the noble Apoſtle ſpeaks of with great ſorrow of heart,<note place="margin">

                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.25.</note> but it is that which is alſo prejudicial unto a Chriſtians good.

                  <p>Fourthly, <hi>To be Carnally minded, is for to have the Mind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed upon ſinful concernments, ſo the Life thereby proves vain and Carnal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That ſo if you take the Carnal man into examination, you ſhall find, that he has not ſo much as a thought for God; What <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks of the Wicked,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10 4</note> may in this caſe be applyed; <hi>The Wicked through the pride of his countenance, will not ſeek af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter God;</hi> and the beſt character he can give of him, is this, <hi>God is not in all his thoughts.</hi> We may conclude upon it, that man may be truly counted Carnal, that hath not a thought for God in all his wayes; Therefore miſerably Carnal may we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that ſoul to be, that doth at no time or ſeaſon ſet his Mind on the things of God. The Apoſtle doth further ſpeak in this caſe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15.</note> ſaying, <hi>That unto them that are defiled and unbelieving, is nothing Pure, but even the Mind and Conſcience is defiled;</hi> and being left in the Carnal Nature, it comes to paſs, that they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject the Truth, and become oppoſers of it to this day; Now as <hi>Jannes</hi> and <hi>Jambres</hi> withſtood <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.8.</note> ſo do theſe alſo reject the Truth, men of corrupt minds, reprobate; or may be read, (of no judgement) concerning the Faith.

                  <p>Fifthly, <hi>In a word, to be Carnally minded, is to walk in that Path which is attended with ſin, which leads to the Chambers of Death.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>That let the Carnal minded man go where he will, he cannot take one ſtep but in much danger, and the farther he goes in his Carnal Mind, the deeper he falls into ſin; and the more he ſins, the higher he aggravates his miſery; and if his Carnal Mind is not changed, and ſo leave him before Death ſeize on him, the man is for ever undone without recovery.

                  <p>It is that which is much the concernment of a Chriſtian, to ſettle his Heart upon his Treaſure; Now where is a Chriſtians Treaſure but in Heaven? therefore a Chriſtians Heart ſhould be in Heaven; Oh! this was the Bleſſed Doctrine that flowed from the Lips of our dear Lord Jeſus, <hi>Where your Treaſure is,</hi>

Another mans Treaſure is his Pleaſure, and his Heart is ſetled there: ſo a true Chriſtians Treaſure is in Chriſt, and his heart is affected with none but Chriſt. It was the Fathers pleaſure to enrich his Son with the Treaſure of Wiſdom and Knowledge, to the end that we might be enriched by him,<note place="margin">

Oh! ſhall Chriſt manifeſt love to us, and ſhall we manifeſt unkindneſs unto him? Shall Chriſt ſet his Heart upon us, and ſhall we ſet out Hearts upon any beſides him? Oh! ſhall Dear Jeſus be willing to give Royal entertainment to us, and ſhall we be unfree for to entertain him?
